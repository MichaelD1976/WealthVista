            **WealthVista** is a financial projection tool designed to help individuals model long-term **investment accumulation** and **retirement drawdown** scenarios with clarity and flexibility.

            ### What It Does
            This app allows you to:
            - Simulate how your investments might grow over time with custom asset allocations and annual contributions
            - Explore the impact of **market returns**, **contributions**, and **one-time lump sums** (deposits or withdrawals)
            - Visualise drawdown phases to see how **regular withdrawals** affect the portfolio over retirement
            - Switch between accumulation and drawdown phases to gain a full-picture understanding of your WealthVista

            ### How It Helps
            Whether you're **planning for retirement**, testing different asset allocation strategies, or managing withdrawals in later life, **WealthVista** gives you insight into:
            - The long-term sustainability of your portfolio
            - When and how wealth peaks and declines
            - The effects of different asset growth characteristics, compounding and strategic allocation decisions

            Get started by selecting **Accumulation** or **Drawdown** from the sidebar to begin your personalized projection.
